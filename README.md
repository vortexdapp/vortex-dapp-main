# Vortex Dapp

Vortex is a rev-sharing token launcher platform designed to simplify the launch of ERC20 tokens by providing first-block initial liquidity lending on EVM-compatible blockchains. With Vortex, users can create a token and have it instantly live and tradable on Uniswap with initial liquidity provided by stakers, with 2 clicks.

## Test Vortex

Vortex Dapp is currently live on Sepolia Testnet.
You can also try it on Base and Optimism, although current initial liquidity pool is set with a symbolic amount per token created, until our fundaraise. You can also add funds to the pool, by staking ETH on your preferred chain.
