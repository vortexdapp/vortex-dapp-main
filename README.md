# Vortex Dapp

Vortex is a rev-sharing token launcher platform designed to simplify the launch of ERC20 tokens by providing first-block initial liquidity lending on EVM-compatible blockchains. With Vortex, users can create a token and have it instantly live and tradable on Uniswap with initial liquidity provided by stakers, with 2 clicks.

## Test Vortex

Vortex Dapp is currently live on Sepolia Testnet. You can try it here: [vortexdapp.com](https://vortexdapp.com)

You can also try it on Base and Optimism, although current initial liquidity pool is set with a symbolic amount per token created, until our fundaraise. You can also add funds to the pool, by staking ETH on your preferred chain.


## Features

- **Multi-Chain Support**: Vortex Dapp is optimized to work on Base, OP, Arbitrum, BSC, Sepolia, and others. (Currently only live on Sepolia)
- **Token Creation**: [Launch](https://launch.vortexdapp.com/factory) new tokens with initial liquidity without costs and without coding.
- **Staking**: [Stake](https://launch.vortexdapp.com/stake) your ETH to contribute to the Vortex LP Lending Pool and earn 30% of the trading fees of tokens created through Vortex.
- **Trading**: [Trade](https://launch.vortexdapp.com/trade) tokens created on the Vortex platform.
